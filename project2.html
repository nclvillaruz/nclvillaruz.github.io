Project Description:<br>
I interpreted "technology changing what it means to be human" as technology taking over our lives and ultimately breaking down and destroying humanity. This video portrays the importance of taking time for yourself and even going on a social media cleanse. Everyone is always trying to show their best self on social media, and being exposed to this daily (and not know what goes on behind the scenes is deptrimental to one's mental health. Taking a hiatus from technology can in turn cultivate positivity.

Project Descrption:<br>
I initially started this project while experimenting on Sketchfab, where I manipulated a 3D object. The results of my experimentation made the final product resemble shattering roses. I was inspired both by the appearance of this 3D model and the theme of my piece for Project 1.<br>
The rose motif in these projects made me think of romance and love. With using Meshmixer, I tried to find objects that symbolized my chosen theme. Things like hearts, roses, vines, and the tree, when thrown together portray a garden. The hearts growing on trees, and the oversized rose bushes add an extra dreaminess to the piece, which can relate back to the same feelings emanated from Project 1. I also used a similar color scheme by picking a light dusty pink color.<p>

Project Descrption:<br>
Adding onto the previous assignment, I incorporated an interactive feature which created depth. I wanted to keep the feature simple by just having a circular drawing effect behind the flower. On the actual art piece, I have a blue background, and a white cloud in a corner to portray the sky. The colors I chose for the effect were white when not holding down the mouse, and blue when the mouse was pressed. The white would represent clouds, and the blue would act to "erase" the clouds since it blends in with the background.<p>
